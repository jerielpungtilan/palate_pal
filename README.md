## Inspiration
- Working in primary and urgent care and seeing people be unable to properly manage their conditions
- Too much food in the fridge to throw away 
- Too busy to have time to plan recipes and exercise
- iOS and Android Health apps that track user health and make recommendations 

## What it does
> Collects data from health plan, generates meal plan, fitness routine and grocery list according to medical requirements

## How we built it
- First we zoomed in to a specific problem
- Looked for the audience that this problem would affect
- Formulated a way to solve these problems in the most efficient way.
- Received feedback from mentors
- inspiration from other apps and what they are doing well. 


## Challenges we ran into
> First idea didnâ€™t work out, we needed to repeatedly pivot and iterate on our past attempts. 
> Had to adapt to unforeseen obstacles and circumstances (Flutter not working, internet going down)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Proof of concept app, taking an idea and realizing a prototype
- Creating a tool to help a large amount of people with some of their most pressing needs
- Being able to work as a team

## What we learned
- Reframing the problem
- Program development from concept, requirements, design, building, testing 
- Learned to be creative and adaptable
- Group workflow process, task delegation 

## What's next for PalatePal
- Being able to generate a health report to send to healthcare providers
- Doctor iterates on their health plan, which is then uploaded back to PalatePal
